You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,0,0]


Output: 2

Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.

Example 2:

https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png


Input: root = [0,3,0]

Output: 3

Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.

1 <= n <= 100

0 <= Node.val <= n

The sum of all Node.val is n.


Detailed Explanation:
TreeNode Class:

__init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None): Initializes a node with a given value and optional left and right children. The default value is 0, and the default children are None.

Solution Class:

distributeCoins(self, root): This method calculates the minimum number of moves required to balance the coins in the binary tree.

DFS Helper Function:

dfs(node): A helper function that performs a depth-first search on the binary tree.

Base Case: If the node is None, return 0 (indicating no excess coins to move).

Recursive Case: Recursively call dfs on the left and right children to calculate their excess coins.

Moves Calculation: Add the absolute values of left and right to self.moves, representing the total moves needed to balance the coins at this node.

Net Coins Calculation: Return the net number of coins to be moved to the parent node. This is calculated as node.val + left + right - 1, representing the current node's value plus the left and right excess coins 
minus the coin needed for the node itself.

Example Usage:

Constructs two sample binary trees and uses the distributeCoins method to calculate and print the number of moves required for each tree.
