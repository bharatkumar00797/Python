This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findRelativeRanks` that takes a list of integers `score` representing the scores of athletes in a competition and returns a list of strings representing their ranks.

1. The method first sorts the `score` list in descending order to determine the ranks.
2. It then creates a dictionary `rank_dict` to map each score to its corresponding rank (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or the numeric rank).
3. Next, it iterates through the original `score` list and appends the corresponding rank from `rank_dict` to the `answer` list.
4. Finally, it returns the `answer` list containing the ranks of the athletes.

This code efficiently assigns ranks to athletes based on their scores and handles ties by giving the same rank to athletes with the same score.
